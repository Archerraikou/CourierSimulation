# Courier Company Simulation

A c++ simulation of a day for a Courier Company. Made in 3 steps.

1. The first implementation was made without using any OOP concepts.
2. The second one used many OOP concepts, such as polimorfism, inheritence, upcasting.
3. The final implementation was made using as many OOP concept as possible, adding Design patters, downscasting, abstract classes, etc.

The program needs to simulate:
- recieving orders
- sending drivers to pick the orders up and deliver them
- optimising the selection of the vehicles based on time or on capacity
- having constant information about the current location of all vehicle
- having drivers follow the optimal route to the pickup/dropoff location
